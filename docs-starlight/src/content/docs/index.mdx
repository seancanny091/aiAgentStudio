## What It Does

AI Agent Studio is a **production-grade orchestration system** for AI agents on Salesforce. It handles LLM interactions, tool execution, memory management, multi-agent workflows, email processing, human-in-the-loop approvals, security controls, and observability — all natively on the Salesforce platform with no external infrastructure.

## Why AI Agent Studio

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Production-Ready Architecture" icon="seti:settings">
    Built with Strategy + Factory + Chain of Responsibility patterns. Modular plugin-based design scales from single conversations to high-throughput enterprise deployments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security & Governance First" icon="seti:lock">
    Automatic CRUD/FLS/sharing enforcement, PII masking, provider-native prompt safety, tool dependency validation, and comprehensive audit trails. Agents run in user context with no privilege escalation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensible at Every Layer" icon="seti:code">
    Custom actions for business logic, context providers for dynamic data, LLM provider adapters, custom orchestrators, and configurable memory strategies — extend only what you need.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observable by Design" icon="seti:graph-line">
    Execution storyboard UI, tool rationale capture, token and cost tracking. Built-in visibility for monitoring reliability and business impact.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Agent Types

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Conversational Agents" icon="chat">
    Multi-turn chat assistants with memory and tool execution. Perfect for customer service, sales assistance, and interactive troubleshooting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Function Agents" icon="seti:gear">
    Single-task specialists for classification, enrichment, and automation. Ideal for record enrichment, sentiment analysis, and automated decision-making.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflow Agents" icon="seti:graph-line">
    Orchestrated multi-agent execution with state machines and conditional branching. Native Salesforce reporting on workflow step performance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Agents" icon="seti:mail">
    Email thread processing with automatic continuity and reply generation. Ideal for automated customer support and email triage.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Performance">

**Scalable Async Processing**: Platform Events for high-throughput production environments. Resilient processing with priority ordering, exponential backoff, and automatic recovery.

**Efficient LLM Batching**: Multiple LLM calls can be processed within a single transaction when tool execution allows it, reducing latency and job overhead.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Observability">

**Execution Storyboard**: Visual UI showing complete agent execution timeline with steps, decisions, and outcomes.

**Tool Reasoning**: LLM explains why it selected each tool, captured in execution logs for transparency and debugging.

**Token & Cost Tracking**: Per-step tracking of prompt/completion tokens and estimated costs. Build dashboards to monitor spend.

**Audit Trail**: Complete log of user inputs, LLM responses, tool calls, and results for compliance and troubleshooting.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extensibility">

**Custom Actions**: Extend with business logic by creating Apex classes implementing `IAgentAction`. Full access to Salesforce data and external integrations.

**Context Providers**: Supply dynamic data to agents via `IAgentContextProvider`. Bulk-safe queries with security enforcement.

**LLM Providers**: `OpenAIProviderAdapter` ships in core and works with any OpenAI-compatible API (Azure OpenAI, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and more). `VertexAIProviderAdapter` for Google Vertex AI / Gemini is in addons. Add any other provider by extending `BaseProviderAdapter`.

**Memory Strategies**: Implement custom memory management via `IMemoryManager`. BufferWindow and SummaryBuffer included.

## Quick Start

<Aside type="tip" title="Time to First Agent">
You can have a working first agent in about 30 minutes.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Deploy the framework to your org.
2. Configure Named Credentials for your AI provider.
3. Create an LLM Configuration.
4. Create an AI Agent Definition.
5. Add capabilities and configure approvals.
6. Place the chat component on a Lightning page and test.
</Steps>

Start with the guided setup and iterate from observability data.
